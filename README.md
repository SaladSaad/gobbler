# Gobbler

Gobbler is a universal wishlist for movies, shows, books, anime, games, and more. It tracks content you want to consume along with what you have consumed. It also provides a single platform to view content ratings, promotional information (trailers, clips, etc), and streaming information. Of course, it'll do all this only when it's ready... if it'll ever be ready.
